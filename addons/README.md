# Addons
These would be addons you install after configuring the base operating system on the pi.

These are not automated since you might not want all of them.

Check the _hostname_ directory as an example. Each _custom_ directory of an _addon_ can have multiple scripts in it which are executed in the numbered order in the same way as _os_ handles it.

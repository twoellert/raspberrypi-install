# Install, Customize and Configure RaspberryPI
Scripts in here offer:
* Automatic configuration executing multiple steps via SSH to customize your basic raspberry pi installation. See _os_ directory.
* Store addons for additional functionality. See _addons_ directory.

## HOWTO
Usually you want to perform the following steps:
* Check directory _os_ for base operating system installation
* Check directory _addons_ for additional functionality to be installed on top of the base operating system setup

Multiple _addons_ can be installed but check their functionality if they contradict or influence each other.

The directory _scripts_ contains general commonly used scripts within _os_ and _addons_.
